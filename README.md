# Introduction

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen + move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

In addition, there will be 3 levels for player to chooses, from easy to hard. To choose, click the level and click play. Each level will have different speed and different bullets limit.
